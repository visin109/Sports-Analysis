Dream-11:
I created a Dream 11 Team players by calculating various statistics of a player and used it to Classify them into all-rounders, batsman, and bowlers and picked a powerful team of 11 cricket players. Statistics such as Average, Strike rate, the highest number of runs, sixes, fours, number of '50s,100's, Highest wicket-takers, and addition which team have more winning probability, etc. were used for team creation and have been analyzed, visualized, and summarized in detail in this project.
